Last night I cried


Give me a second, give me a minute
Nah, lil' bitch, can't let you finish
Yeah, that's right, I need commission on mine
All that sauce you got from me
All that shit I gave for free
I don't want it back, want it back
This ain't no warnin' shot
In case all you hoes forgot
Know you been more than lost
Without me, I'm so
Comin' like I'm so greasy
Ex-nigga, he so needy
Punk ass tried to replace me, but the stakes just too high
They can't survive off mini-me's
I'm talkin' pedigree
Ain't no writers, that's just me
Ain't no spiteful, I'm just T
Can't hate a bitch for free
Talkin' I'm off the bench like Brady
I'm pressin' niggas like KD, it's up
Yeah, nigga, it's up to me
Remind you of Della Reese
So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not
I talk bullshit a lot
No more fuck-shit, I'm done
Damn right, I'm the one
Damn right, I'm the one
Comin' back, she so candid
Comin' back, snatched like bandit
Comin' back, this ain't canned shit, I'm organic with my fresh squeeze
I'm dumpin' like press squeeze
I'm horny like, "Suck these", so darin' like, "Touch me"
And all the petty shit aside
All the phony shit aside
I just want what's mine
Mine, oh
I just want what's mine
This ain't no warnin' shot
In case all you hoes forgot
And I cried and cried
Said what's on my mind
Ooh-oh-woah, I cried


I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving
I'm so mature, I'm so mature, I'm so mature
Got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should


I might
I might kill my ex
Not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next
How'd I get here?
I might kill my ex
I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone


I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement playing on my patience
Now you laying facedown
Got me saying over a beat


I'm so mature, I'm so mature, I'm so mature
Got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will, oh


I might kill my ex
Not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next
How'd I get here?
I might kill my ex
I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone


I did it all for love
I did it all on no drugs
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh


I did it all for love
I did all of this on no drugs
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us?


Oh
I just killed my ex
Not the best idea
Killed his girlfriend next
How'd I get here?
I just killed my ex
I still love him though
Rather be in hell than alone
You push me past my own capacity, boy
Permission to crash, collectin' damages, boy
No reachin' and grabbin', far more clarity now
Seek and destroy, oh, missiles deployed


Do it to you, do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh-oh-oh-woah-ah
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you, do it to you
I hate to do it to you, damn
Do what I gotta do (Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah)


I can't stand it, the urge
It's so demandin', I'm hurt
So necessary, the art of war
God damn, man, I'm dreamin'
Now that I've ruined everything, I cannot complain
Now that I've ruined everything, I'm so fuckin' free
Now that I've ruined everything, keep it all for me
Now that I've ruined everything, space is all I need


Do it to you, do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh-oh-oh-woah-ah
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you, do it to you (Oh-oh, ah-ah)
I hate to do it to you, damn
Do what I gotta do (Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah)


Chasin' fatter ass and fake connections
Chasin' for signs in all directions
Chances I ride, got no directions
Beggin' my angels for protection (Do it to you, oh)
Danger arise and not deflectin'
New dick arrives and I erect it
Beggin' my angels for protection
Make him a star, they directless
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Do it to you, do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh-oh-oh-woah-ah
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you, do it to you (Oh-oh, ah-ah)
I hate to do it to you, damn
Do what I gotta do (Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah)


All the hate I know
Is used to fuel my soul
No controllin'
Do it to you, do it to you, uh
All the hate I know
Is used to heal my soul
No controllin'
Do it to you, do it to you, oh
Tell 'em it's you
I'm at the loot, I'm at a rage
Oh, stay out the way


Comin' down the side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me all cho-chosin' violence
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet


Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it up, nobody know shit


I need you to get the fuck off my space (Yeah)
Replacements on the way with the rage
The pussy's feelin' like a great escape (Ah-ah)
I don't need no drink, orders don't change
I'm fuckin', I ain't makin' love no more (Pussy)
You got a new bitch, what the fuck you cryin' for?
I'm movin' selfish, callin' all my favorite hoes
You know how to reach me every time and it plays in your mind
No rest, I feel fly, we can meet in your car
And the way I've been alone, I'm gon' save you a spot
You can't be outside 'cause the block is too hot
I'm, and I'm all on your mind
Wherever you are, don't call me (Let's go)


Comin' down the side of me, I like to get it poppin' (Alright)
But these bitches in my business got me all cho-chosin' violence (Yeah, yeah)
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent (Oh, hey)
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet


Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it up, nobody know shit (Yeah)
Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it up, nobody know shit


I need total confidential private shit (Yeah)
No one knows, thinkin' I'm a grown bitch (It's lit)
Times have changed, now we on the first-class jet (Straight up)
Don't work my nerves, you know I get bored of that
We fuckin', we ain't makin' love no more
You talk that talk, but he know my intuition strong
Wherever you are, whatever you need
Don't call me, don't worry 'bout me


Comin' down the side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me all cho-chosin' violence (Alright)
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet


Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it up, nobody know shit
Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it up, nobody know shit (Let's–)


Fuck you, real shit
I wasn't even on, fuck you
But you tryna make me look stupid
I'll slap the dog shit out of you, stop playin' wit' me
Said, "Patience ain't no virtue with you"
I done wasted plenty time pacin' around, hate this coupe
You with bitches on the side and let my mind wonder too
You relentless, nigga, I don't need rent, nigga
Text me like I'm waiting for you to come lie to me
All my days sayin', just to hurt me, I can't compete
Still on the way, I lay awake, give you none around me
I'm so on to you, still gone for you


Needin' you to talk to me in your love language
Show me, yeah, how to connect to you
Help me understand how you speak your love language


Bad as I wanna be yours, I can't get with your program
Sexin' like a slow jam, stick around 'cause I want to
Bad as I wanna keep focus, you remind me I'm imperfect
And it sucks to admit
Nobody put that purpose in me like you do, still
Nobody get that work up out me like you do
Nobody get the truth about me quite like you
You the definition of my right hand
Never mind ridin' backseat when you leave me


Talk to me in your love language
Show me, yeah, how to connect to you
Help me understand how you speak your love language


Call me like you can't suppress memories of me
Call me like you got confessions queued up
Like ya' last bitch, lookin' chewed up, baby
Call me like you don't regret missin' this old thing
Babe, call me
You know the difference between me and chickens


You don't wanna be, be without me
You don't want to leave
I don't want to die, ooh, no
I don't wanna be alone, oh
All that I know is mirrors inside me
They recognize you, please don't deny me


Oh-oh, mm-mm, mm


Everything disgustin', conversation is so borin'
Heard about what? I ain't heard, I don't agree, I did it first
I give a fuck, I just wanna fuck, eat, sleep, love happy
Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?


Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?


I need humanity
You're like humanity, drownin' in vanity
Cravin' humanity
You're like humanity, I need humanity
I need–


Anybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual
Scared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate
You reflect all the godlike, you forget how to love somebody
I hate everybody, I hate everyone
Let's talk about A.I., robot got more heart than I
Robot got future, I don't, robot can't sleep
But I don't power down, I'm wide open, I'm awake
I'm on autopilot, I'm out of my mind and I'm wide open


Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?


I need humanity
You're like humanity, drownin' in vanity
Cravin' humanity
You're like humanity, I need humanity
I need–


[Phoebe Bridgers:]
You said all of my friends are on my payroll
You're not wrong, you're an asshole
Screaming at you in the Ludlow
I was yours for free
I don't get existential
I just think about myself and look where that got me
Standin' on my own in an airport bar or hotel lobby
Waiting to feel clean
It's so fucking boring


[SZA:]
Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?


I need humanity

Cravin' humanity
You're like humanity, I need humanity

[SZA (Sadhguru):]
Those who have forsaken their humanity
They like to patch their life with morality
(I think I might be tryna patch my life with morality)
Curious, I'm curious


Kiss me dangerous
Been so lost without you all around me
Get anxious
Lead me, don't look back
It's all about you


In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about


Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn (You ain't deserve)


Broad day, sunshine
I'll find a way to fuck it up still
Can't cry about the shit that I can't change
Just my mind
Gotta get outta here
Tough crowd, hate it
Can't stay


In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about


Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn


It's what you say and how you do me
How I'm 'posed to trust, baby? 'Posed to love?
It ain't supposed to hurt this way
All I need is the best of you
Baby, how I got to say it? Give me all of you


In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about


Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn (You ain't deserve)
