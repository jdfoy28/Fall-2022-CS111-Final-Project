# Fall-2022-CS111-Final-Project


The first body of text I chose was an album by Smino.The second body of text is SZA’s most recent album. For both, I compiled the lyrics to different songs, and put them in one text file. The bodies of texts I choose were specific songs off the album that I did not include in my main text. For example, I left out the song ‘ihateu’ by SZA, so that I can use it for my comparison.


I ran a total of 10 tests, and 4 out of 10 returned the correct match. After I ran my tests, I realized that the artist I chose are close to each other in the genre. Had I picked two very different artists, such as Adele and Smino, I believe my program would have provided more accurate results. However, I think my program worked well given how similar the artists were. One thing that can be improved is the length/efficiency of my code. Some of my functions are long, and if I had more time, I would try and condense the size of my functions. Additionally, I would pick a different initializer/add more so that I can make it be more selective when determining similarities.
