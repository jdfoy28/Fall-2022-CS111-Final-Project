Guess I been used to being used like this
Ain't no difference, I'm immortalizing my thoughts
Praise to the most high for protection
Over my most prized possessions
Talkin' 'bout my sanity's at a 6.7, handin' out poinsettias
To my dead homie mothers, prayin' they feel better
Might get shit mindin' my business
Might get chipped sharin' my vision
Might as well, can't tell if it's even worth conversation
Need a prayer, do it even work?
All that's for real, it's forever
Moments stolen taste better

I've been ridin', ridin' through this cold world
Thought you had another, went and caught up with ol' girl
I feel like it's over
Something's callin' to get closer
I'm out of touch, I need your love, I wish a mile away
Then you weren't sure, weren't sure, we're goin' out the way
I feel like it's over
Something callin' to get closer

Countin' my blessings twice as much
Let death stress me too much
Can't hide from pressure, too worried I'm livin' a lie
Can't trust nobody you ain't been broke with
Niggas tryna break my focus, bitch, I'm Obi Wan
You caught in the laser
Thought it'd be easy to get myself
Oh, I need you, but it takes time
And I'm out of patience, I burnt it with you
Can't lose myself to your ego, I wanna say
You loved me better when you tried less
I don't take much, just need your honesty, oh
Love will work better when you confess
Feelings don't need discussion
Spend my life discoverin' new shit
