I don't like nobody, I don't feel guilty about it
I just got my body done, ain't got no guilt about it
I just heard your opinion, I could've did without it
All these bitches is minions, despicable like, ooh (Oh)
Feelin' like Mike Lowrey, oh
Proud about my salary, oh, oh (Oh)
Heard they callin' me out
Love it when they callin' me out, oh, woah


I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool, oh-woah
I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool


I got everything that I need, and I want more
I can't take my foot off they neck, it's an encore
I got everything and I'm livin' off of revenge
I been burnin' bridges, I'll do it all over again
'Cause I'm bettin' on me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me
Ooh, I'm bettin' on me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, oh


Heard you fuckin' these lames, ain't lose no sleep about it
Always speakin' my name, I can't lose no sleep about it
Say that shit to my face, you know I'm gon' slide about it
Put that bitch in her place, she ain't make no peep about it
Oh (Oh), feelin' like a million, oh
Feelin' like I might drill on your hoe, oh (Oh)
I'm just livin' my goals (Goals)
Passion and violence, can't fold, oh, woah


I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool, oh-woah
I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool


I got everything that I need, and I want more (More)
I can't take my foot off they neck, it's an encore (Encore)
I got everything and I'm living off of revenge
I been burnin' bridges, I'll do it all over again
'Cause I'm bettin' on me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me
Ooh, I'm bettin' on me
