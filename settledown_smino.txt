​​Settle down
Just settle down
I, uh, uh
Just settle down


Imagine my mama ain't never had kids
Imagine Obama ain't never win shit
Imagine I didn't have to go visit my nigga
Wasn't in no fuckin' prison, hold on
Imagine I never met Lil' Monty
[?] where we became homies
Imagine we makin' the babies change somethin'
I mean, they all on the same beats
They all with the same beats
[?], please, unless the [?] 'round me


Still doin' my best
Ain't worried 'bout nothin' they squeezin', no stress
Got on- got on- got on them racks
Nigga, we blessed
I'm doin'— I'm doin'— I'm doin' by best
Ain't worried 'bout nothin' they squeezin', no stress (Stress, stress, stress)


I'm just takin' my time, I'd kill for this
(La-la-la-la, la-la)
And I love when the wind blow
Niggas ain't 'bout to shine, I tell my kids that
But, then they wanna go slow


Mhm, excuse me?
You cute, I'm choosy (Just settle down)
Mhm, excuse me? (Baby)
You cute, I'm choosy (Just settle down)
Mhm, excuse me? (Settle down)
You cute, I'm choosy (Just settle down)
Mhm, excuse me? (Settle down)
You cute, you cute (You cute)


This to Mr. Underground, Country Grammar, [?] with a bunch of manners
Right there off of 70 and West Florissant, I'm more than just a bunch of banter
Been two nights in a 38, make the world revolve around you
Said my love for rent, ain't gave a cent to make sense, it's beautiful, my sentiments


Still doin' my best
Ain't worried 'bout nothin' they squeezin', no stress
Got on- got on- got on them racks
Nigga, we blessed
I'm doin'— I'm doin'— I'm doin' by best
Ain't worried 'bout nothin' they squeezin', no stress (Yes, Stress, stress, stress)


I be really tryin', tryin' to find the time
Like I lost my watch, protect me, Lord, oh, God
Makin' up haters in your mind sound like self-hate to me
Imagine everybody lovin', and that's what you gon' see
Likes don't equal love today, where I reside
Imagine really flyin', a magic trick I'm tryin'
[?] sweetest clementines
Imagine not havin' to just imagine all the time


Shoo, shoo, shoo (Don't move a—)
Shoo, shoo, shoo (But, I just—)
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo (Do what you do, but, watch my—)
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo


I don't wanna think of somethin'
You wanna take it off me
I wanna take off somethin'
You wanna take it off me
