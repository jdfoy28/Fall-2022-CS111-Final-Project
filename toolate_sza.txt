Too late for us
We're both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?


I been gone so long, I don't know where I'm going
You be on my phone, talkin' 'bout what's my problem?
I done go alone and get it how I want it'
Had to be alone to out figure how I should be loved
And if it's just us, is that enough?
Is it bad that I want more?


Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared to love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?


See, bust it like a toolie in your waistband
Bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
Bust it like you catchin' a body and you in G stance
Bust it like it's casual Friday and you hear two things
Call bluff, I know what's up, can't get enough
Is it bad that I want more?


Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared to love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?


Mmm, pressure, I won't learn my lesson
I want you to stretch it, limit, want you to test it
I know I was born to roll, I gotta know
Is it bad that I want more?


Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared to love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?


Showdown with you
Nobody hear me like you do
Every time you break my heart, it feel new
Every time I fall up, ought to call you
I just wanna be loved, loving shucks
I can't enough, is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
